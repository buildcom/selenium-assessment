* Correctly use Page Objects and AssertJ to the best of your abilities.
* Make sure the code compiles without issue when running "mvn test", and that all tests pass. 
* Upload completed assessment to your own repository and share the link to your repository so we can review your code.

Bonus points:
* Make the tests work with multiple browsers (Firefox, Safari, etc.)

More bonus points (be impressive):
* Make the tests work with Appium: using Safari on iOS and/or Chrome on Android.
